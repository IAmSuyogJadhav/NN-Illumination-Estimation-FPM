Open options to explore:
	Framewise illumination correction OR
	Correction for the entire set-up of illumination

Open options to explore:
	Uniform angular illumination variation
	Some randomness in the illumination angle - defined as a parameter to be learnt (~100 mrad)

Open options to explore:
	Use microscopy for amplitude and phase (to be provided by Florian)
	Use landscape images for amplitude and phase (imageNet, red- amplitude, green - phase)
	Use random distributions for creating amplitude and phase (distribution choice - gaussian with mean 2^7, std - we fix later )

Expected output of NN: List of x and y (sub-pixel precise location...) - k0x and k0y
